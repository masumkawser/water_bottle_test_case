 Test Description for Water Bottle Object Testing

Objective:  
To validate the physical, functional, and safety aspects of a water bottle through various object testing techniques.
 Test Scope:

1. Material & Durability Testing
   - Verify the water bottle is made from approved, non-toxic, BPA-free materials.
   - Conduct drop tests from different heights to ensure the bottle doesn't crack or leak.
   - Test for resistance to scratches and normal wear and tear.

2. Leakage Test
   - Fill the bottle with water and invert it to check for leaks.
   - Apply pressure to the bottle to simulate different usage scenarios and check for any leakage.

3. Cap & Seal Integrity
   - Test the functionality of the cap to ensure it opens and closes smoothly.
   - Ensure the seal is tight enough to prevent water from escaping, even when the bottle is shaken.

4. Temperature Retention
   - If the bottle is thermal, measure how well it retains the temperature of hot and cold liquids over time.
   - Test with both hot and cold water, recording the temperature drop or increase over a set duration.

5. Capacity Test
   - Verify that the bottle can hold the specified volume (e.g., 500ml, 1L) accurately.
   - Fill the bottle to its stated capacity and confirm there is no overflow.

6. Ergonomics & Usability
   - Check the comfort of holding the bottle for different hand sizes.
   - Test the grip and ensure that itâ€™s non-slip, even when wet.

7. Cleaning & Maintenance
   - Test how easy it is to clean the bottle, including hard-to-reach areas like the inside and around the cap.
   - Verify if the bottle is dishwasher-safe (if applicable).

8. Safety & Toxicity Test
   - Ensure the bottle does not release harmful chemicals into water, especially when exposed to heat.
   - Conduct tests for odor and taste to confirm that the bottle does not affect the flavor of water.
   - 
 Reporting:
- Record findings in a test log.
- Note any physical defects, performance issues, or inconsistencies in the product testing.
